### Description

The goal of this project is to show you how to Image-to-Latex Web application by your own OCR model from scratch

### Step1. Training a image-to-latex OCR using machine learning

Latex formulas are trained on the base [**LaTeX-OCR**](https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR) model. I add additional data to improve the model's ability to recognize LaTeX expressions, especially for Matrix and Align. 

### Step2. Create a frontend web page 

This project use [**react-landing-page-template-2021**](https://github.com/samanthajiang/react-landing-page-template-2021) 
as the base template. See deploy instruction in the original repository.

### Step3. Create a backend api

How to show prediction result on the webpage? [**Flask**](https://github.com/pallets/flask) serves as api to connect frontend and backend. See `backend/pix2tex/api/app.py` and `src/components/Upload_image.tsx` to see how frontend and backend communicate.

### Step4. Deploy on the web

### Step5. SEO

### Step6. GoogleAd

This project use [**react-landing-page-template-2021**](https://github.com/samanthajiang/react-landing-page-template-2021) 
as the base template. See deploy instruction in the original repository.
